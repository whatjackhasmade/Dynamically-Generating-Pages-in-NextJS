## Dynamically Generating Pages in NextJS using WordPress

Previous to NextJS 9, implementing dynamic routes for your NextJS setup was a bit of a pain. It required you to understand passing in query parameters to a custom back-end, fetching the data required to render the route and then passing it back to NextJS to create the page.

With the introduction of NextJS 9, you can now dynamically create routes for your site in under 10 minutes with a little configuration.

I've setup a guide on how to do just that with a real-world example using my WordPress setup. The WordPress setup uses custom endpoints but these will work with the default REST endpoints introduced in WordPress 4.7.0.
